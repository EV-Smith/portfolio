        I've been creating short films since high school, but I've been able to take my hobby to a professional level in my role at the Museum. I've created several video interviews with various artists, taken trips to artist studios to capture their work in action, created time lapse videos of artist installations, and even a stop motion animation in collaboration with New York-based fiber artist Nathan Vincent.

      <h3>Nathan Vincent: Let's Play War!</h3>

        <p>New York-based fiber artist Nathan Vincent recently held his first solo museum exhibition at Bellevue Arts Museum. The installation consisted of two scaled up toy soldier armies created with foam and epoxy and covered in painstakingly crocheted skins. The end result is two eerily child sized armies which moved position each day in the Museum galleries. I realized that since most visitors would only visit the Museum once during the duration of the show, the majority of viewers wouldn't be able to appreciate the interactivity of the exhibition. I contacted the artist and suggested a stop motion animation simulating the play hinted at in the title to address this problem. Fortunately for me, he was game for the project and decided on the sequence and music. This one was particularly fun!

        <p>In order to promote the Museum's upcoming <em>The New Frontier: Young Designer-Makers in the Pacific Northwest</em> exhibition, I visited Graypants Studio's gorgeous SoDo studio space to capture their designers at work on <em>Cloud</em>. I am particularly proud of this video out of all of my videos. The exhibition's co-curator and well-known Seattle photographer Charlie Schuck told me that I'm gifted and should quit my job to focus on my videography. I'm still working off the glow of that compliment. </p>
